## 📥 Install  

### Option 1:  
Download **Mains Plug Search V1.rar**, extract it, and run the application directly from the folder.  
This will contain an `.exe` file along with all the required dependencies to run on your Windows computer without issues.  

### Option 2:  
Download the required files:  
- [`plugs.py`](plugs.py)  
- [`images/`](images/) folder  

### 📦 Install Required Python Packages  
```sh
pip install pillow tk
```

### 🐧 Linux Dependencies  
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk -y
```

### 🖥 Windows Considerations  
On Windows, `tkinter` is included with standard Python installations.  
If `pillow` isn’t installed, run:  
```sh
pip install pillow
```

### 🍏 Mac Considerations  
`tkinter` is included with official Python distributions from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
If using Homebrew Python, you may need:  
```sh
brew install python-tk
```
